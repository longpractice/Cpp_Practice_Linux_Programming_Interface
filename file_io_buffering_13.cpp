/* write_bytes.c

   Write bytes to a file. (A simple program for file I/O benchmarking.)

   Usage: write_bytes file num-bytes buf-size

   Writes 'num-bytes' bytes to 'file', using a buffer size of 'buf-size'
   for each write().

   If compiled with -DUSE_O_SYNC, open the file with the O_SYNC flag,
   so that all data and metadata changes are flushed to the disk.

   If compiled with -DUSE_FDATASYNC, perform an fdatasync() after each write,
   so that data--and possibly metadata--changes are flushed to the disk.

   If compiled with -DUSE_FSYNC, perform an fsync() after each write, so that
   data and metadata are flushed to the disk.

/*

Exercise 13-3
What is the effect of the following statements?
fflush(fp);
fsync(fileno(fp));

Answer:
fflush works on the stream buffer in user space, it transfer the buffer in user space to the system space
fsync works on a lower level, it does not know the stream. It makes sure that the content in system space goes inside the physical media.
For a further discussion: see  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2340610/difference-between-fflush-and-fsync

Therefore:
 fflush(fp)
 fsync(fileno(fp))
working together makes sure that the file stream goes to the physical media.
